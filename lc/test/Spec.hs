-- True

-- Note: The above test case is too britle since its success depends on the choice of the fresh variable `y1` chosen to avoid variable capture.
-- To make the test more robust, it would be better to check that the two terms are alpha equivalent instead. 
-- Note: Checking if two terms are alpha equivalent is not part of the minimum goal.

-- `(λx.λy.x y) y` reduces to a term that is alpha equivalent to `λz.y z`
-- >>> alphaEq (reduce (App (Abs "x" (Abs "y" (App (Var "x") (Var "y")))) (Var "y"))) (Abs "z" (App (Var "y") (Var "z")))
-- Variable not in scope: alphaEq :: Term -> Term -> t
